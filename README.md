# SProxy

SProxy, a free, open-source, very fast, reliable, and simple proxying software for TCP and HTTP-based applications, built on NodeJS for redirecting data from request to another server for sake of security and used during server side whitelisting. 

A Proxy Server is a gateway or an intermediary server that takes a client request, passes it on to one or more back-end servers, and subsequently fetches the response from the server and delivers it back to the client, thus making it appear as if the content originated from the reverse proxy server itself.


SProxy is non-caching request proxy powered by an event-driven, non-blocking engine that combines a very fast I/O layer with a priority-based, multi-threaded scheduler which enables it to easily deal with tens of thousands of concurrent connections. 

# Common Use Cases:
